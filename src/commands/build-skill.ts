# Regulations.gov Comment Browser

AI-analyzed public comments on U.S. federal regulations, published as static JSON. Each docket
has been processed through an analysis pipeline: comments are condensed into structured summaries,
organized by a hierarchical theme taxonomy, and tagged with recognized entities (organizations,
standards, programs). Theme-level narrative summaries synthesize the positions and arguments.

## Available Dockets

*Updated ${generatedDate}*

| Docket ID | Title | Agency | Closed | Comments | Themes |
|-----------|-------|--------|--------|----------|--------|
${docketTable}

## Fetching Data

All data is publicly hosted as static JSON. Fetch any file by URL.

**URL pattern:**
\`\`\`
${baseUrl}/{DOCKET_ID}/data/{FILE}
\`\`\`

Example: \`${baseUrl}/${dockets[0]?.id || "HHS-ONC-2025-0005-0001"}/data/meta.json\`

## How to Approach Different Queries

Think about what the user actually needs before fetching data. The pre-built theme summaries
are excellent for overview questions but lack granularity. Full comments have everything but
require searching. Here's the decision tree:

### "What are people saying about X?" / Broad sentiment questions
1. Fetch \`themes.json\` to find the relevant theme code(s)
2. Fetch \`theme-summaries.json\` to get the pre-written narrative analysis
3. These summaries include stakeholder positions, areas of consensus/disagreement, and representative arguments
4. For deeper per-comment detail on a theme, fetch \`theme-extracts.json\` — it has each commenter's
   specific positions, concerns, recommendations, and quotes broken out by theme

### "What did [organization] say?" / Entity-specific questions
1. Fetch \`entities.json\` to find the entity's label and category
2. Fetch \`indexes/entity-comments.json\` to get the comment IDs for that entity
3. Fetch \`comments.json\` and filter to those IDs

### "Find comments that mention..." / Specific search queries
1. Fetch \`comments.json\` (the full set) and search through the text fields
2. Each comment's \`structuredSections.detailedContent\` has the full text
3. \`keyQuotations\` often captures the most notable passages

### "Give me an overview of this docket"
1. Fetch \`meta.json\` for high-level stats
2. Fetch \`themes.json\` for the theme hierarchy — this shows the landscape of issues
3. Optionally fetch \`theme-summaries.json\` for the top themes

### General principle
**Strongly prefer the full comments as your primary source.** The \`comments.json\` file contains
each commenter's \`detailedContent\` (faithfully condensed from the original submission) along with
submitter name, type, and profile — this is the unadorned ground truth of what people actually said.
Theme summaries, extracts, and entity indexes are useful for orientation and navigation, but they
are pre-digested interpretations. Whenever a query seems to require or benefit from source-level
analysis — specific arguments, direct quotes, who said what, or any question where nuance matters —
go to the full comments. The pre-canned themes and summaries are a convenient map, but the comments
are the territory.

## Data Files Reference

### meta.json
High-level statistics for the docket.

\`\`\`json
{
  "documentId": "HHS-ONC-2025-0005",
  "generatedAt": "2026-03-09T00:41:13.931Z",
  "stats": {
    "totalComments": 305,
    "condensedComments": 305,
    "totalThemes": 73,
    "totalEntities": 85,
    "scoredComments": 302,
    "themeSummaries": 69
  }
}
\`\`\`

### themes.json
Hierarchical theme taxonomy. Level 1 themes are broad categories; level 2 are specific sub-themes.

\`\`\`json
[
  {
    "code": "1",
    "description": "Health IT Certification Framework and Strategic Reform",
    "level": 1,
    "parent_code": null,
    "detailed_guidelines": "This theme addresses the overarching evolution...",
    "comment_count": 85,
    "direct_count": 85,
    "touch_count": 0,
    "children": ["1.1", "1.2", "1.3", "1.4"]
  },
  {
    "code": "1.1",
    "description": "Federal Safety Floor and Deregulatory Philosophy",
    "level": 2,
    "parent_code": "1",
    "detailed_guidelines": "This sub-theme focuses on the debate over...",
    "comment_count": 212,
    "children": []
  }
]
\`\`\`

- \`code\`: Theme identifier (e.g., "1", "1.1", "5.3")
- \`detailed_guidelines\`: Detailed scope definition — read this to understand what the theme covers
- \`comment_count\`: Number of comments tagged with this theme
- \`children\`: Sub-theme codes (empty for leaf themes)

### theme-summaries.json
Pre-written narrative analyses for each theme. These are substantial — typically 500-2000 words
each — and cover stakeholder positions, consensus areas, disagreements, and notable arguments.

Array of objects, each with:
- \`theme_code\`: Matches \`code\` in themes.json
- \`theme_description\`: Theme title
- \`structured_summary\`: Narrative analysis text (may include markdown headers and formatting)

### theme-extracts.json
Per-comment, per-theme extracted content. This is the richest source of theme-specific evidence —
each entry captures exactly what one commenter said about one theme, broken into structured facets.
Useful when you need specific quotes, individual positions, or want to drill into a theme beyond
what the narrative summaries provide.

Keyed by theme code, then by comment ID:

\`\`\`json
{
  "1.1": {
    "HHS-ONC-2025-0005-0042": {
      "positions": [
        "Supports maintaining a federal safety floor for certified health IT..."
      ],
      "concerns": [
        "Removing certification criteria could allow vendors to drop features..."
      ],
      "recommendations": [
        "Publish a crosswalk mapping removed criteria to alternative safeguards..."
      ],
      "experiences": [
        "Implemented FHIR at a 25-bed rural hospital where the certification..."
      ],
      "key_quotes": [
        "The house won't fall if the bones are good, but we need to define..."
      ]
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

- Each array contains the commenter's actual arguments, specifics, and evidence for that theme
- Arrays are empty \`[]\` when the commenter didn't address that facet
- This file can be large — consider fetching \`theme-summaries.json\` first for an overview,
  then using theme-extracts only when you need per-comment granularity

### entities.json
Entity taxonomy organized by category. Entities are organizations, standards, programs, and
concepts mentioned across comments.

\`\`\`json
[
  {
    "category": "Artificial Intelligence & Automation",
    "entities": [
      {
        "label": "Agentic AI",
        "definition": "Autonomous AI systems capable of pursuing multi-step goals",
        "terms": ["agentic AI", "agentic artificial intelligence", "AI agents"],
        "mentionCount": 61
      }
    ]
  }
]
\`\`\`

- \`category\`: Grouping label (e.g., "Health IT Standards", "Government Bodies")
- \`label\`: Canonical name
- \`terms\`: Variant names/aliases to search for in comment text
- \`mentionCount\`: How many comments mention this entity

### comments.json
All comments with structured summaries, theme scores, and entity tags.

\`\`\`json
[
  {
    "id": "HHS-ONC-2025-0005-0002",
    "documentId": "HHS-ONC-2025-0005",
    "submitter": "Jane Doe",
    "submitterType": "Individual",
    "date": "2025-05-15T04:00:00.000Z",
    "hasAttachments": false,
    "wordCount": 1250,
    "clusterSize": 1,
    "clusterRepresentativeId": null,
    "structuredSections": {
      "oneLineSummary": "Supports FHIR-based interoperability but warns...",
      "commenterProfile": "Healthcare IT consultant with 15 years...",
      "corePosition": "The commenter supports the shift toward...",
      "keyRecommendations": "1. Maintain minimum safety certification...",
      "mainConcerns": "Removing certification criteria could allow...",
      "notableExperiences": "Describes implementing FHIR at a rural...",
      "keyQuotations": "- \\"The house won't fall if the bones are good\\"...",
      "detailedContent": "Full condensed text of the comment..."
    },
    "themeScores": ["1.1", "5", "7.2"],
    "entities": [
      { "category": "Health IT Standards", "label": "FHIR" },
      { "category": "Government Bodies", "label": "ONC" }
    ]
  }
]
\`\`\`

**Submitter fields** (top-level on each comment):
- \`submitter\`: Name of the person or organization
- \`submitterType\`: "Individual" or "Organization"
- \`date\`: Submission timestamp

**\`structuredSections\`**:
- \`detailedContent\`: **The most important field.** A faithful markdown transcription of the
  original comment text plus all PDF attachments. This is the closest thing to the raw submission
  and should be your go-to for source-level analysis.
- \`commenterProfile\`: Who the commenter is, their expertise, role, and stake
- \`oneLineSummary\`: Quick overview of the comment's position
- \`corePosition\`: The central argument (1-2 paragraphs)
- \`keyRecommendations\`: Specific proposals, often numbered
- \`mainConcerns\`: Problems or risks identified
- \`keyQuotations\`: Notable direct quotes from the original comment

Together, the submitter metadata and \`detailedContent\` provide a full picture of who said what.
The other \`structuredSections\` fields are useful shortcuts but are AI-distilled from the same source.

\`themeScores\` is an array of theme codes (from themes.json) that this comment is relevant to.

\`clusterSize\` > 1 indicates a form letter; \`clusterRepresentativeId\` links to the representative.

### indexes/theme-comments.json
Maps theme codes to arrays of comment IDs.

\`\`\`json
{
  "1": { "direct": ["HHS-ONC-2025-0005-0003", "..."], "touches": [] },
  "1.1": { "direct": ["HHS-ONC-2025-0005-0003", "..."], "touches": [] }
}
\`\`\`

Use this to quickly find which comments are relevant to a specific theme without loading all comments.

### indexes/entity-comments.json
Maps entity labels (as "Category|Label") to arrays of comment IDs.

\`\`\`json
{
  "Health IT Standards|FHIR": ["HHS-ONC-2025-0005-0002", "..."],
  "Government Bodies|ONC": ["HHS-ONC-2025-0005-0003", "..."]
}
\`\`\`

## Tips

- **Default to the source material.** The full comments (\`comments.json\`) provide deeper, more
  granular, and less lossy insights than any pre-canned summary. Themes, extracts, and entity
  indexes are great for orientation, but should not be over-relied upon — reach for the original
  comments unless the user's request is clearly satisfied by a high-level summary.
- When searching comments, \`structuredSections.detailedContent\` is the most comprehensive field,
  but \`keyQuotations\` and \`keyRecommendations\` are useful for targeted searches.
- Theme codes are hierarchical: "1.1" is a sub-theme of "1". Use the parent for broader analysis.
- \`entities.json\` includes \`terms\` arrays with aliases — use these when searching comment text.
